# FoilPack-Installer
Made this ages ago, here is proof that I make an installer for some Minecraft mods.
The database it uses is thankfully not hosted anymore, the program will still launch though (takes a while, just wont load any mods). If you want to host the database (for some reason?), I used a Microsoft SQL server hosted by "Amazon RDS for SQL Server" and I believe two underscores were used for spaces, check the example one (it may be outdated as it's a backup from before the database was deleted).
Also sorry for all the spelling mistakes/bad code if you look through it.
