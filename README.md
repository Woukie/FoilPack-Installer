# FoilPack-Installer
An installer for a few minecraft mods. Does not work anymore.
The database associated with the program is not hosted anymore, you can use ModData.mdb to see what was being hosted (I used __ for returns in the mod description).

This is an old project that allows you to download/update Minecraft mods.
It had features like choosing specific mods to update/install, installing forge, backing up pre-existing mods, guessing your mod directory, downloading mod dependancies and worked off a database that would keep a direct download link to the correct version of the mod and provide the mod with a description.

The installer will still open but will take a long time and there will be no mods listed as the database is down, I am not too proud of the code and I dont want to come back to it as I don't play modded anymore.

Feel free to ask me any questions.
